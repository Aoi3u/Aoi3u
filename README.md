## Hi there 👋
- I'm a CS student.
- I'm currently learning web development.

## 🖥️ Web Development
For front-end development, I am studying **HTML**, **CSS** (including Bootstrap and TailwindCSS), and **JavaScript**. <br>
For back-end development, I am focusing on **PHP** with **Laravel**. <br>
I am also learning the basics of AWS for infrastructure. <br>
